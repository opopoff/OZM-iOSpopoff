/**
 `when` is a mechanism for waiting more than one asynchronous task and responding when they are all complete.

 `PMKWhen` accepts varied input. If an array is passed then when those promises fulfill, when’s promise fulfills with an array of fulfillment values. If a dictionary is passed then the same occurs, but when’s promise fulfills with a dictionary of fulfillments keyed as per the input.

 Interestingly, if a single promise is passed then when waits on that single promise, and if a single non-promise object is passed then when fulfills immediately with that object. If the array or dictionary that is passed contains objects that are not promises, then these objects are considered fulfilled promises. The reason we do this is to allow a pattern know as "abstracting away asynchronicity".

 If *any* of the provided promises reject, the returned promise is immediately rejected with that promise’s rejection. The error’s `userInfo` object is supplemented with `PMKFailingPromiseIndexKey`.

 @warning *Important* In the event of rejection the other promises will continue to resolve and as per any other promise will eithe fulfill or reject.

In such situations use `PMKJoin`.
